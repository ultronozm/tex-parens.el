* Overview
Emacs comes with the following useful commands for working with lists, sexps and defuns (see the info nodes [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Expressions.html][Expressions]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Defuns.html][Defuns]]):

| bind            | command            | docstring                                                          |
|-----------------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-M-@           | mark-sexp          | Set mark ARG sexps from point or move mark one sexp.               |
| C-M-a           | beginning-of-defun | Move backward to the beginning of a defun.                         |
| C-M-b           | backward-sexp      | Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).               |
| C-M-d           | down-list          | Move forward down one level of parentheses.                        |
| C-M-e           | end-of-defun       | Move forward to next end of defun.                                 |
| C-M-f           | forward-sexp       | Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).                |
| C-M-h           | mark-defun         | Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.                 |
| C-M-k           | kill-sexp          | Kill the sexp (balanced expression) following point.               |
| C-M-n           | forward-list       | Move forward across one balanced group of parentheses.             |
| C-M-p           | backward-list      | Move backward across one balanced group of parentheses.            |
| C-M-t           | transpose-sexps    | Like C-t (‘transpose-chars’), but applies to sexps.                |
| C-M-u           | backward-up-list   | Move backward out of one level of parentheses.                     |
| C-M-<backspace> | backward-kill-sexp | Kill the sexp (balanced expression) preceding point.               |
| -               | up-list            | Move forward out of one level of parentheses.                      |
| -               | delete-pair        | Delete a pair of characters enclosing ARG sexps that follow point. |
| -               | raise-sexp         | Raise N sexps one level higher up the tree.                        |

This package provides analogous commands adapted for tex buffers, with the class of parenthesis-like delimiters (namely, parentheses =()=, brackets =[]= and braces ={}=) expanded to include the following:
- =\begin{...}= - =\end{...}= pairs
- math environment delimiters =$...$=, =\(...\)=, =\[...\]=, =$$...$$=
- mathematical delimiters: parentheses, brackets, braces, =\langle= - =\rangle=, =\lvert= - =\rvert=, etc., and compositions of these with modifiers such as =\left= - =\right=, =\Bigg=, etc.  See =M-x customize-group tex-parens= for details.

There is some support in this direction in the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/TeX-Mode.html][tex-mode]], in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]] and in [[https://github.com/Malabarba/latex-extra][latex-extra]].  There are many packages, such as [[https://paredit.org/][paredit]] and [[https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy][lispy]], that add further useful commands and bindings to lisp modes, and many other packages, such as [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens,]] [[https://github.com/AmaiKinono/puni][puni]] and [[https://github.com/purcell/paredit-everywhere][paredit-everywhere,]] that aim to give consistent parenthesis-based commands across all modes.  There's also the [[https://github.com/iyefrat/evil-tex][evil-tex]] package for those that prefer a modal setup.  I was unable to get these packages to behave in the desired manner.  Smartparens comes close, but doesn't seem to support arbitrary begin/end pairs, and has some issues when one delimiter is a prefix of another (https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/issues/1193).  This package should work out-of-the-box and behave in tex buffers just like stock Emacs does in lisp buffers.

* Configuration
This package is available via GNU ELPA, so you can install it using =package-install= or =list-packages=.  You can activate it via =M-x tex-parens-mode=, which remaps binds for the commands listed above to their =tex-parens-*= counterparts.

To activate automatically, add the following lines to your config (the first hook applies if use the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/TeX-Mode.html][tex-mode]], the second if you use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]]):
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package tex-parens
  :hook
  (tex-mode . tex-parens-mode)
  (TeX-mode . tex-parens-mode))
#+end_src

For finer control over how keys are bound, you can avoid =tex-parens-mode= and instead use something like the following:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package tex-parens
  :bind
  (:map LaTeX-mode-map
        ("C-M-f" . tex-parens-forward-sexp)
        ("C-M-b" . tex-parens-backward-sexp)
        ("C-M-n" . tex-parens-forward-list)
        ("C-M-p" . tex-parens-backward-list)
        ("C-M-u" . tex-parens-backward-up-list)
        ("M-u" . tex-parens-up-list)
        ("C-M-g" . tex-parens-down-list)
        ("M-_" . tex-parens-delete-pair)
        ("C-M-SPC" . tex-parens-mark-sexp)
        ("C-M-k" . tex-parens-kill-sexp)
        ("C-M-t" . tex-parens-transpose-sexps)
        ("C-M-<backspace>" . tex-parens-backward-kill-sexp)
        ("M-+" . tex-parens-raise-sexp))
  :hook
  (tex-mode . tex-parens-setup)
  (TeX-mode . tex-parens-setup))
#+end_src

The precise use-package declaration that I use may be found in [[https://github.com/ultronozm/emacsd/blob/main/init-latex.el][the LaTeX part of my config]] (elpaca branch).

Use =M-x customize-group tex-parens= to configure further.  If you tweak the customization variables concerning delimiters and modifiers, then you'll need to reload your tex file, reset the minor mode, or do =M-: (tex-parens-setup)= for the changes to take effect.

* Variants
This package contains the following additional functions defined in terms of the sexp/list primitives:

- =tex-parens-burp-left=, =tex-parens-burp-right=: Slurp or barf sexps in and out of the current list.
- =tex-parens-mark-inner=: Mark the innermost balanced group around point.
- =tex-parens-beginning-of-list=, =tex-parens-end-of-list=: Move to the beginning or end of the current balanced group.
- =tex-parens-kill-to-end-of-list=, =tex-parens-kill-to-beginning-of-list=: Kill text between point and the end or beginning of the current list.

See the =C-h f= documentation for each function for more details.  They may be bound in the same manner as described above.

** Avy Integration
There are additional commands that use Avy to jump to and copy math expressions:

- =tex-parens-avy-jump-to-math=: Jump to and enter a math expression using Avy.
- =tex-parens-avy-copy-math=: Copy a math expression selected using Avy.

To use these commands, make sure you have Avy installed and loaded, then bind them in your config as described above.
