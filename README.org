* Overview
Emacs comes with the following useful commands for working with lists, sexps and defuns (see the info nodes [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Expressions.html][Expressions]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Defuns.html][Defuns]]):

| bind            | command            | docstring                                                          |
|-----------------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-M-@           | mark-sexp          | Set mark ARG sexps from point or move mark one sexp.               |
| C-M-a           | beginning-of-defun | Move backward to the beginning of a defun.                         |
| C-M-b           | backward-sexp      | Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).               |
| C-M-d           | down-list          | Move forward down one level of parentheses.                        |
| C-M-e           | end-of-defun       | Move forward to next end of defun.                                 |
| C-M-f           | forward-sexp       | Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).                |
| C-M-h           | mark-defun         | Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.                 |
| C-M-k           | kill-sexp          | Kill the sexp (balanced expression) following point.               |
| C-M-n           | forward-list       | Move forward across one balanced group of parentheses.             |
| C-M-p           | backward-list      | Move backward across one balanced group of parentheses.            |
| C-M-t           | transpose-sexps    | Like C-t (‘transpose-chars’), but applies to sexps.                |
| C-M-u           | backward-up-list   | Move backward out of one level of parentheses.                     |
| C-M-<backspace> | backward-kill-sexp | Kill the sexp (balanced expression) preceding point.               |
| -               | up-list            | Move forward out of one level of parentheses.                      |
| -               | delete-pair        | Delete a pair of characters enclosing ARG sexps that follow point. |
| -               | raise-sexp         | Raise N sexps one level higher up the tree.                        |

This package provides analogous commands adapted for tex buffers, with the class of parenthesis-like delimiters (namely, parentheses =()=, brackets =[]= and braces ={}=) expanded to include the following:
- =\begin{...}= - =\end{...}= pairs
- math environment delimiters =$...$=, =\(...\)=, =\[...\]=, =$$...$$=
- mathematical delimiters: parentheses, brackets, braces, =\langle= - =\rangle=, =\lvert= - =\rvert=, etc., and compositions of these with modifiers such as =\left= - =\right=, =\Bigg=, etc.  See =M-x customize-group tex-parens= for details.

There is some support in this direction in the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/TeX-Mode.html][tex-mode]], in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]] and in [[https://github.com/Malabarba/latex-extra][latex-extra]].  There are many packages, such as [[https://paredit.org/][paredit]] and [[https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy][lispy]], that add further useful commands and bindings to lisp modes, and many other packages, such as [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens,]] [[https://github.com/AmaiKinono/puni][puni]] and [[https://github.com/purcell/paredit-everywhere][paredit-everywhere,]] that aim to give consistent parenthesis-based commands across all modes.  There's also the [[https://github.com/iyefrat/evil-tex][evil-tex]] package for those that prefer a modal setup.  I was unable to get these packages to behave in the desired manner.  Smartparens comes close, but doesn't seem to support arbitrary begin/end pairs, and has some issues when one delimiter is a prefix of another (https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/issues/1193).  This package should work out-of-the-box and behave in tex buffers just like stock Emacs does in lisp buffers.

* Configuration
Download this repository, install using =M-x package-install-file= (or package-vc-install, straight, elpaca, ...), and add something like the following to your [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InitFile][init file]], adjusting the binds according to preference (and replacing =LaTeX-mode= with =latex-mode= or =tex-mode= or =plain-tex-mode=, whichever is appropriate, if you don't use AUCTeX):
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package tex-parens
  :bind
  (:map LaTeX-mode-map
        ([remap forward-sexp] . tex-parens-forward-sexp)
        ([remap backward-sexp] . tex-parens-backward-sexp)
        ([remap forward-list] . tex-parens-forward-list)
        ([remap backward-list] . tex-parens-backward-list)
        ([remap backward-up-list] . tex-parens-backward-up-list)
        ([remap up-list] . tex-parens-up-list)
        ([remap down-list] . tex-parens-down-list)
        ([remap delete-pair] . tex-parens-delete-pair)
        ([remap mark-sexp] . tex-parens-mark-sexp)
        ([remap kill-sexp] . tex-parens-kill-sexp)
        ([remap transpose-sexps] . transpose-sexps)
        ([remap backward-kill-sexp] . tex-parens-backward-kill-sexp)
        ([remap raise-sexp] . tex-parens-raise-sexp))
  :hook
  (LaTeX-mode . tex-parens-setup))
#+end_src
With this setup, whatever binds you generally use for the indicated list commands will be forwarded to =tex-parens= in =LaTeX-mode=.  If you want to specify the keys more directly, use instead something like the following:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package tex-parens
  :bind
  (:map LaTeX-mode-map
        ("C-M-f" . tex-parens-forward-sexp)
        ("C-M-b" . tex-parens-backward-sexp)
        ("C-M-n" . tex-parens-forward-list)
        ("C-M-p" . tex-parens-backward-list)
        ("C-M-u" . tex-parens-backward-up-list)
        ("M-u" . tex-parens-up-list)
        ("C-M-g" . tex-parens-down-list)
        ("M-_" . tex-parens-delete-pair)
        ("C-M-SPC" . tex-parens-mark-sexp)
        ("C-M-k" . tex-parens-kill-sexp)
        ("C-M-t" . transpose-sexps)
        ("C-M-<backspace>" . tex-parens-backward-kill-sexp)
        ("M-+" . tex-parens-raise-sexp))
  :hook
  (LaTeX-mode . tex-parens-setup))
#+end_src

The precise use-package declaration that I use may be found in [[https://github.com/ultronozm/emacsd/blob/main/init-latex.el][the LaTeX part of my config]] (elpaca branch).

Use =M-x customize-group tex-parens= to configure further.  If you tweak the customization variables concerning delimiters and modifiers, then you'll need to reload your tex file or =M-: (tex-parens-setup)= for the changes to take effect.

* Variants
This package contains the additional functions =tex-parens-burp-left=, =tex-parens-burp-right=, =tex-parens-mark-inner=, =tex-parens-beginning-of-list= and =tex-parens-end-of-list=, which are defined in terms of the sexp/list primitives; see the =C-h f= documentation for details.
